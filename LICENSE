This software is open source but not free software. You are not permitted
to distribute, use, or otherwise copy this software unless you meet the
requirements stated below.

Open Source and Non Commercial Use
If you are a developer of an open source project (defined as being generally
and freely available to the public for use) or you are otherwise not selling
software related to the Github repo you intend to use this software for,
you are given a free license to download and use the software to import
issues into your public repos in which you are not making money from. You are also
allowed to run this software against a private test repository, which is not meant
to be used after testing is completed as well, in order to validate that this
software suits your needs.

Closed Source and Commercial Use
If the Github repo which you are importing issues into is private (other than for
test purposes) or you are a commercial entity that makes money directly or indirectly
from the associated repository, you are required to purchase a license. Licenses are
priced based on the number of YouTrack users each, and one license covers importing
from a single YouTrack installation into any number of Github repositories, private or
public. There is no limit to the number of times you can run
the software, and the license granted to you for a given repository does not expire.
You may use any version of the software you wish, the license is tied to the YouTrack
installation, not the version of the software. Licenses are priced as follows:

- Users 1-100: $4 each
- Users 101-200: $3 each
- Users 201-300: $2 each
- Users 301+: $1 each

If you continue running the software, ensure that the number of users does not increase,
or you must pay for a larger license.

Contact the software author for payment instructions.

Licenses do not include support, please ensure that the software meets your needs
by running it against a private test repository before purchasing licenses.

Software Modifications
You are allowed to modify the software to fit your needs, but you are not allowed to
further distribute the software.
